# Traffic
### Simulation of traffic in a given set of intersecting streets.
This project is a simulation of traffic in a set of streets. Those streets intersect at right angles and generate intersections.
Traffic at intersections is controlled with traffic lights. Vehicles have a set of statistics such as maximum velocity and
distance held from the next vehicle.
